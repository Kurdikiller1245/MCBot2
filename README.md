## In Action
![discord-irc](http://i.thedestruc7i0n.ca/I5anbg.gif)

## Installation and usage

In your Minecraft server.properties, make sure you have and restart the server:
```
enable-rcon=true
rcon.password=<your password>
rcon.port=<1-65535>
```

Clone repository onto a server, edit ```config.json``` (see below for more info) and change any options, and then, in the repository folder:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Run the following on your server hosting (in a screen/tmux session or background process, make sure to replace your `YOUR_URL` with whatever URL you're using (`localhost:8000` if running on the same server and default config) and `PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_INSTALL` with the path to the Minecraft server installation, such as `/usr/home/minecraft_server/`):

``` sh
tail -F /PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_INSTALL/logs/latest.log | grep --line-buffered ": <" | while read x ; do echo -ne $x | curl -X POST -d @- http://YOUR_URL/minecraft/hook ; done
```

You can also easily Deploy to Heroku or Bluemix, just be sure to edit `YOUR_URL` in the command to match accordingly.
